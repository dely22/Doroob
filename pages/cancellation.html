                    <hr>
                    <h4>Right of withdrawal</h4>
                    <p> You have the right to cancel this contract within fourteen days without giving any reason. The cancellation period is fourteen days from the day on which you or a third party named by you who is not the carrier has taken possession of the goods.</p>

                    <p> To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must contact us <span> (Doroob Almokha 40 street, near Althawra Stadium city Sana’a-Yemen).</span></p>

                    <p> by means of a clear declaration (e.g. a letter sent by post, fax or email) of your decision to withdraw from this contract. You can use the attached model withdrawal form for this purpose, but this is not mandatory.</p>
                    <p> To meet the cancellation deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your notification of exercising your right of cancellation before the cancellation period has expired.</p>

                    <h4> Consequences of the withdrawal</h4>
                    <p> If you withdraw from this contract, we will have given you all payments that we have received from you, including delivery costs (with the exception of the additional costs that result from choosing a different type of delivery than the cheapest standard delivery we offer have), to be repaid immediately and at the latest within fourteen days from the day on which we received notification of your cancellation of this contract. For this repayment, we will use the same means of payment that you used for the original transaction, unless something else was expressly agreed with you; In no case will you be charged any fees for this repayment.</p>
                    <p> We can refuse the repayment until we have received the goods back or until you have provided evidence that you have sent the goods back, whichever is earlier.</p>
                    <p>You must return or hand over the goods to us immediately and in any case no later than fourteen days from the date on which you informed us of the cancellation of this contract. The deadline is met if you send the goods before the period of fourteen days has expired. You bear the direct costs of returning the goods.</p>
                    <p> You only have to pay for any loss in value of the goods if this loss in value is due to handling of the goods that is not necessary to check the nature, properties and functionality of the goods.</p>
                    <hr>

                    <h4>The right of withdrawal does not apply to contracts, among other things
                    </h4>
                    <p>&#9679; for the delivery of goods that are not prefahricated and for the production of which an individual selection or determination by the consumer is decisive or which are clearly tailored to the personal needs of the consumer,</p>

                    </h4>
                    <p>&#9679; for the delivery of alcoholic beverages, the price of which was agreed when the contract was concluded, but which can be delivered no earlier than 30 days after the conclusion of the contract and whose current value depends on fluctuations in the market over which the entrepreneur has no influence.</p>

                    <h4>The right of withdrawal expires prematurely in the case of contracts, among other things
                        for the delivery of sealed goods that are unsuitable for return for reasons of health protection or hygiene if their seal has been removed after delivery,</h4>
                    <p>&#9679; for the delivery of goods if they were inseparably mixed with other goods after delivery due to their nature.</p>
