                    <h3>Doroob AL-Mokha Coffee</h3>
                    <p>Yemeni Coffee Has Been World Famous Since The 17th Century, When The Country First Began Exporting Coffee Through Its Port Of Al-Mokha. Coffee Quickly Became Popular In Europe, And Coffee Houses Began To Rise Culturally Where The Mysterious Drink From Yemen Was Enjoyed. For Many Years The Word Mocca Was Synonymous With Coffee From Yemen, And While The Word Has Since Taken On New Meanings That Are Not Related To The Country, Coffee In Yemen Remains Unique In A World Market That Is Characterized By Increasing Standardization And Homogenization Of Coffee Production Was Subjected.
                        <span class="read-more-text">
                            Yemeni Coffee Is Grown In The Same Way Today As It Was In The 15th Century When Coffee Exports First Began. The Coffee Is Grown In Small Quantities On Mountain Terraces And In Narrow Mountain Eagles, Where Natural Methods Of Growing And Drying At High Altitude Produce Small Beans With Unique Fruity Flavors Of Cocoa, Apricots, Berries, Raisins, And Figs. Since Coffee Cultivation In Yemen Has Never Been Homogenized, The Original Strains Of The Arabica Plant Evolved In Remote Parts Of The Mountainous High Country, Where Local Varieties Are Among The Oldest Genotypes Still Grown Worldwide. High Production Costs In Connection With Water Scarcity, Small Agriculture And Low Production Yields Make Yemeni Coffee One Of The Most Expensive Types Of Coffee In The World. If Farmers In Yemen Are Given The Opportunity To Export Their Unique Product, They Can Secure A Livelihood As The Majority Of The Proceeds Go Directly To The Farmer. Yemen Has A Unique Beauty, Skilled Farmers, Artists, And Businesses. You Didn't Have A Lot Of Chances In The Many Years Of War And Conflict, But We Started To Work on Doroob Almokha And Get The First Products For Germany And The Western World.
