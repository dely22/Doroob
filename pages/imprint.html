                                All content on our website was created with the greatest care and to the best of our knowledge. However, we cannot assume any liability for the correctness, completeness and topicality of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with general law in accordance with Section 7 (1) of the German Telemedia Act (TMG). According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, as a service provider, we are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which we become aware of a specific legal violation. If we become aware of the above legal violations, we will remove this content immediately.

                            <p>Our website contains links to external third party websites. We have no influence on the content of these directly or indirectly linked websites. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the correctness of the content of the "external links". The respective providers or operators (authors) of the pages are responsible for the content of the external links.

                            <p>The external links were checked for possible legal violations at the time the links were set and were free of illegal content at the time the link was set. A constant review of the content of the external links is not possible without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. In the case of direct or indirect links to the websites of third parties that are outside our area of responsibility, a liability obligation would only exist if we became aware of the content and it would be technically possible and reasonable for us to prevent its use in the event of illegal content.
                            </p>
                            <p>This disclaimer of liability also applies to links and references made by questionnaires, blog entries and guests of the discussion forum on the website “<a href="www.DoroobAlmokha.com">www.DoroobAlmokha.com</a>”.</p>
                            <p>For illegal, incorrect or incomplete content and in particular for damage resulting from the use or nonuse of information presented in this way, the service provider of the page to which reference was made is solely liable, not the person who merely refers to the respective publication via links. If we become aware of legal violations, we will remove the external links immediately.</p>
