                        <p>We process your personal data on the website as follows (for further data processing on the website, please refer to the following paragraphs of this data protection declaration):</p>
                        <span>&#9679; Log files when you visit the website</span>
                        <p> When using our website, our hosting provider records so-called "log file" data each time the server is accessed, such as the name of the website accessed, the previously visited page ("referrer" URL), product and version information of the browser used and the operating system, requesting provider, date and time of access, search engines used, country of access, amount of data transferred, names of downloaded files and IP address.</p>
                        <p>The legal basis for the processing is Article 6 Paragraph 1 f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest in storing the log file data lies in ensuring system security, including the investigation of misuse. The IP address is deleted after a maximum of 7 days, unless it is needed longer due to a security incident, e.g. for clarification or for evidence purposes.</p>

                        <p>In the case of contact inquiries, we process your personal data such as name, address, email address, telephone number, etc., which we need to answer your inquiry.</p>
                        <p>The legal basis for the processing of your personal data in the context of contact inquiries is Art. 6 Para. 1 b) General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
                        <p> In the context of contact inquiries, we store your personal data for as long as is necessary to process your inquiry, plus an appropriate retention period for queries.</p>
                        <p> The provision of this personal data is not required by law or contract, nor is it necessary for the conclusion of a contract. If you do not provide us with this data, however, we will not be able to answer your contact request or - in the case of limited contact details - not answer all of the communication channels requested.</p>
                        <span>&#9679; Registration / orders: </span>
                        <p> When you register or place an order, we process your personal data such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, date of birth, self-selected user name, payment data, etc., which we use to fulfill the contractual relationship with you or to carry out pre-contractual measures, which are made at your request.</p>
                        <p> We store your personal data collected in the context of registration or orders for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the contractual relationship (if applicable, including the provision of the customer account) and / or to carry out pre-contractual measures and / or with regard to your request is required for warranty, guarantee or comparable obligations and / or with regard to statutory retention periods.</p>

                        <p>The provision of this personal data is not required by law or contract. However, it is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, i.e. the implementation of the registration or order, insofar as the relevant information in our registration / order process is mandatory (instead of only voluntary).</p>
                        <span>&#9679; Newsletter:</span>
                        <p>When you register for our newsletter, we process the data collected, such as your e-mail address, salutation, etc. for the purpose of sending the newsletter.</p>
                        <p> The legal basis for the processing of your personal data in the context of sending our newsletters is Article 6 Paragraph 1 a) General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
                        <p> We store the personal data that we need to send the newsletter until you revoke your consent to receive the newsletter.</p>
                        <p> Insofar as information is mandatory (instead of voluntary) in the context of the newsletter registration, we cannot accept your newsletter registration without this information.</p>
